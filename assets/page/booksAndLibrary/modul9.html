            <!-- B. MATERIAL DESCRIPTION -->
            <section>
                <h2>B. Material Description</h2>
                <p>Idiomatic expressions are phrases where the overall meaning is different from the literal meanings of
                    individual words. They often reflect cultural or contextual meanings and are widely used in everyday
                    English conversations.</p>

                <h3>Common Idioms Covered:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hit the books</strong> – to study hard</li>
                    <li><strong>Break the ice</strong> – to start a conversation, especially to relieve tension</li>
                    <li><strong>Under the weather</strong> – feeling sick or unwell</li>
                    <li><strong>Piece of cake</strong> – something very easy</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs an arm and a leg</strong> – very expensive</li>
                    <li><strong>Let the cat out of the bag</strong> – to reveal a secret accidentally</li>
                    <li><strong>Once in a blue moon</strong> – something that happens very rarely</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Understanding idioms enhances comprehension of informal speech, movies, songs, and conversations with
                    native speakers.</p>

                <h3>Tips for Learning Idioms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay attention to the context in which idioms are used.</li>
                    <li>Practice using idioms in your own sentences to remember their meanings.</li>
                    <li>Listen to native speakers in movies or podcasts to hear idioms in action.</li>
                    <li>Don’t translate idioms literally; focus on the overall meaning.</li>
                </ul>
