      <h1>Module 5: Related Time Expressions</h1>

      <!-- A. OBJECTIVES -->
      <section>
        <h2>A. Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify expressions related to time</li>
          <li>Understand temporal relationships using before, after, during, since, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- B. MATERIAL -->
      <section>
        <h2>B. Material Description</h2>
        <p>This module focuses on time-related expressions that help understand the sequence of events in conversations.
          Common expressions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Before the meeting</li>
          <li>After the break</li>
          <li>During the lecture</li>
          <li>Since yesterday</li>
          <li>By the time..., As soon as..., While, Until, When, Recently, Lately</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These expressions help define when an event happens and are often used to answer questions accurately in
          listening exercises.</p>

        <!-- 5.a: BEFORE / AFTER -->
        <h3>5.a. Before and After</h3>
        <p>These prepositions show that one event happens earlier or later than another.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: Will you be free after class?<br />
          Man: Yes, we can meet after the lecture ends.<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. He will be available following the lecture.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Exercise 5.1</h3>
        <p>Underline the time expressions using "before" or "after" and choose the correct sequence of events.</p>

        <!-- 5.b: DURING / WHILE -->
        <h3>5.b. During and While</h3>
        <p>These are used to express events that occur at the same time as another.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Man: I fell asleep during the movie.<br />
          Narrator: What does the man mean?<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> A. He was sleeping while the movie was playing.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Exercise 5.2</h3>
        <p>Find overlapping actions with "during" or "while" and describe what happened at the same time.</p>

        <!-- 5.c: SINCE / FOR -->
        <h3>5.c. Since and For</h3>
        <p><strong>Since</strong> refers to the starting point of time, while <strong>for</strong> refers to the
          duration.</p>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: How long have you lived here?<br />
          Man: Since 2020.<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. He has been living here from 2020 until now.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Exercise 5.3</h3>
        <p>Identify whether the time expression indicates a starting point (since) or a duration (for).</p>

        <!-- 5.d: UNTIL / BY / AS SOON AS -->
        <h3>5.d. Other Time Markers</h3>
        <p>These markers define deadlines or immediate events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Until:</strong> up to a time (I waited until 10 PM)</li>
          <li><strong>By:</strong> no later than a time (Finish by Friday)</li>
          <li><strong>As soon as:</strong> immediately after something happens</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          Man: I’ll submit the paper by tomorrow.<br />
          Narrator: What does the man mean?<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. He will turn in the paper no later than tomorrow.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Exercise 5.4</h3>
        <p>Match each sentence with the appropriate time expression and its meaning.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- C. REVIEW -->
      <section>
        <h2>C. Review Exercises</h2>
        <p>Identify the correct sequence of events and match time expressions to the appropriate context in
          conversations.</p>

        <h4>Review Example:</h4>
        <blockquote>
          Woman: We’ve been working here since last year.<br />
          Narrator: What does the woman imply?<br />
          <strong>Answer:</strong> A. They started working last year and are still working.
